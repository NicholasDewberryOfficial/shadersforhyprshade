# shadersforhyprshade
Some shaders I've made for hyprshade. Feel free to edit/redistribute. 

Notes:
-A lot of them are based off of solarized.glsl https://github.com/0x15BA88FF/hyprshaders/blob/main/shaders/solarized.glsl

-A lot of them have the exact same comments (thats because I copy pasted them)

-These are VERY unoptimized and lazily made.

-I have these in this folder because I couldn't get the push to branch

-The ones I put in "lowquality" have significant redability issues for me when I tried to use them to go about my daily work.
They made text for the apps/themes I use unreadable. Your mileage may vary. 

-All of the ones under "palettes" are taken from Lopsec. Just google their names to find the OG creators/palettes.

Feel free to do what you want with these.
